How using the files ?

The file exe.py will extract informations from videos .avi and store it in a file
.txt. As they are heavy, use a disk with a lot of free space.
Put line 19 the path from your video's folder.
Put line 31&32 the path of where you want to store the .txt files.


The file gmm_only.py apply the Gaussian Mixture Model on the files .txt.
It creates 3 gmm.npy files (means, covs and weights) in the result folder.
The variable path contains the path of previous gmm classification.
The variable gmm_path contains the path of the gmm classification you will made.
Call with option -g, this python programm will use the previous classification.
Call with option -n X, it will classified videos in X differents categories.


The file fisher_2.py use the same algorithm as gmm_only.py at the beginning.
Then it applies the fisher vectors on the files .txt.
