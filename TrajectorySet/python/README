How using the files ?

The file exe.py will extract informations from videos .avi and store it in a file
.txt. As they are heavy, use a disk with a lot of free space.
Put line 19 the path from your video's folder.
Put line 31&32 the path of where you want to store the .txt files.
/!\ You nned to compile DenseTrackStab.cpp first !


To create gmm and fisher vectors, you need the fisher.so file.
Use files fisher.pyx and setup.py.
Here the command line to create the library (Also create fisher.c): 

python setup.py build_ext --inplace



Once you have the library, you can use fisherVector.py to create gmm (optionnal)
and fisher vectors from the files obtained after the extraction.
The variable path line 22 is where the created files ares saved; 
gmm_path line 23 is where you put your .txt files, descriptors of videos.

fisherVector.py creates fisher_dict.pickle, the disctionnary of fisher vectors for each action's classes, you need for classification. 

Depending on your dataset, you can use classificationUCF.py or classificationHMDB.py.
You can use the first onr for both UCF50 ans UCF101 : the second part split 3 times UCF101 dataset in train/test sets, as recommended on crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php
You can also used the Leave-One-Goup-Out method, as recommanded for UCF50.


If you are using HMDB51 datasets, listHMDB.py creates a dictionnary where each video is associated with a list of numbers.
This numbers indicates if this video is in training, testing or no sets for the different split recommanding on serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/resource/hmdn-a-large-human-motion-database/
The dictionnary is used in classificationHMDB.py


plot.py is for plotting the trajectory in blocks.
