How using the files ?

The file exe.py will extract informations from videos .avi and store it in a file
.txt. As they are heavy, use a disk with a lot of free space.
Put line 19 the path from your video's folder.
Put line 31&32 the path of where you want to store the .txt files.


To create gmm and fisher vectors, you need the fisher.so file.
Use files fisher.pyx and setup.py.
Here the command line to create the library (Also create fisher.c): 

python setup.py build_ext --inplace



Once you have the library, you can use fisherVector.py to create gmm (optionnal)
and fisher vectors from the files obtained after the extraction.
The variable path line 22 is where the created files ares saved; 
gmm_path line 23 is where you put your .txt files, descriptors of videos.

fisherVector.py create 2 files you need for classification.py :
fisher_dict.pickle is the disctionnary of fisher vectors for each action's classes ;
fisher_group.txt divide the files in group.
As it using the technique of Leaving One Group Out, the group are created since
the G-number in videos name as in UCF50 and UCF101 (example of name : 'v_Lunges_g01_c01')
