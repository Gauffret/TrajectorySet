OpenCV Manager is an Android service targeted to manage OpenCV library binaries on end users devices. It allows sharing the OpenCV dynamic libraries of different versions between applications on the same device. The Manager provides the following benefits\:

#. Less memory usage. All apps use the same binaries from service and do not keep native libs inside them self;
#. Hardware specific optimizations for all supported platforms;
#. Trusted OpenCV library source. All packages with OpenCV are published on Google Play service;
#. Regular updates and bug fixes;

Usage model for target user

#. User runs app in the third time  and gets what he or she wants.
